# GitHub Workflow Organization

## Changes Made

### Consolidated Workflows
- **Removed**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` (duplicate)
- **Enhanced**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (comprehensive CI pipeline)

### Single CI Workflow Structure

The consolidated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now includes:

#### 1. **Code Quality Job** (`lint`)
- Runs on Python 3.11
- Installs and runs ruff for linting
- Checks code formatting compliance
- Fast feedback on code quality issues

#### 2. **Test Job** (`test`)
- Runs on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Matrix strategy for comprehensive Python version testing
- Installs project dependencies
- Runs pytest test suite

## Benefits of Consolidation

### ✅ **Efficiency**
- No duplicate test runs
- Single workflow to monitor
- Reduced CI resource usage

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- One file to maintain instead of two
- Consistent trigger conditions
- Unified workflow logic

### ✅ **Clarity**
- All CI checks visible in one place
- Clear job names and descriptions
- Better developer experience

## Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, main ]
```

- Runs on pushes to `master` or `main` branches
- Runs on all pull requests targeting these branches
- Supports both branch naming conventions

## Job Dependencies

- **Lint job**: Independent, runs in parallel with tests
- **Test job**: Independent, runs across Python version matrix
- Both jobs must pass for CI to succeed

## Local Development Commands

For developers working locally:

```bash
# Run linting (matches CI)
ruff check .
ruff format --check .

# Run tests (matches CI)
python -m pytest tests/test*

# Or use Makefile shortcuts
make lint
make test
```

## Windows Compatibility

The workflow uses `python -m pytest` instead of `make test` to ensure compatibility across all platforms, including Windows development environments.

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding these jobs in the future:
- **Coverage reporting** - Add test coverage metrics
- **Security scanning** - Add dependency vulnerability checks
- **Documentation** - Auto-generate and deploy docs
- **Release automation** - Automated PyPI publishing on tags

## Monitoring

- Check workflow status in GitHub Actions tab
- All jobs must pass for PR approval
- Failed jobs will block merging (if branch protection is enabled)
