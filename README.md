# SMDA

SMDA is a minimalist recursive disassembler library that is optimized for accurate Control Flow Graph (CFG) recovery from memory dumps.
It is based on [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) and currently supports x86/x64 Intel machine code.
As input, arbitrary memory dumps (ideally with known base address) can be processed.
The output is a collection of functions, basic blocks, and instructions with their respective edges between blocks and functions (in/out).
Optionally, references to the Windows API can be inferred by using the ApiScout method.

## Installation

With version 1.2.0, we have finally simplified things by moving to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/smda/)!  
So installation now is as easy as:

```
$ pip install smda
```

## Usage

A typical workflow using SMDA could like this:

```
>>> from smda.Disassembler import Disassembler
>>> disassembler = Disassembler()
>>> report = disassembler.disassembleFile("/bin/cat")
>>> print(report)
 0.777s -> (architecture: intel.64bit, base_addr: 0x00000000): 143 functions
>>> for fn in report.getFunctions():
...     print(fn)
...     for ins in fn.getInstructions():
...         print(ins)
...
0x00001720: (->   1,    1->)   3 blocks,    7 instructions.
0x00001720: (      4883ec08) - sub rsp, 8
0x00001724: (488b05bd682000) - mov rax, qword ptr [rip + 0x2068bd]
0x0000172b: (        4885c0) - test rax, rax
0x0000172e: (          7402) - je 0x1732
0x00001730: (          ffd0) - call rax
0x00001732: (      4883c408) - add rsp, 8
0x00001736: (            c3) - ret 
0x00001ad0: (->   1,    4->)   1 blocks,   12 instructions.
[...]
>>> json_report = report.toDict()
``` 

There is also a demo script:

* analyze.py -- example usage: perform disassembly on a file or memory dump and optionally store results in JSON to a given output path.

The code should be fully compatible with Python 3.8+.
Further explanation on the innerworkings follow in separate publications but will be referenced here.

To take full advantage of SMDA's capabilities, make sure to (optionally) install:
 * lief 
 * pdbparse (currently as fork from https://github.com/VPaulV/pdbparse to support Python3)
